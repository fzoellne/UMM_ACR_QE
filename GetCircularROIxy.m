    %Method Description:
    %-------------------
    %From an input array, extract all pixels, that have a distance less or
    %equal to radius from a defined Center (used for extractiong of 
    %circular ROIs from the image). This method does not only return the
    %pixel values, but the indices as well

    [AreaY,AreaX]       = find(~isnan(InputArray));
    Dist                = sqrt((AreaX - CenterX).^2 + (AreaY - CenterY).^2);
    [LinVec]            = find(Dist <= Radius);
    [yVec xVec]         = ind2sub(size(InputArray), LinVec);
    zVec                = InputArray(LinVec);
